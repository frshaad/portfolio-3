        My most recent work stint was with{' '}
        <span className='font-semibold'>Sprinklr</span> where I designed for
        some of its core offerings like Social Media Engagement, Social
        Advertising, Care support and Analytics for big brands with a global
        reach that helped integrate all their social marketing needs under one
        roof. Having led the design team for four years in this young, rapidly
        growing enterprise startup environment - taught me how to balance
        business goals and engineering constraints as I unrelentingly advocated
        for the user.

        I graduated from Symbiosis Institute of Design, India with a degree in
        User Experience Design. I loved the human-centered design methods and
        processes I learned in school and applied them to my thesis project with
        Microsoft R&D, Hyderabad.
        <br />
        <br />I grew up in 7 different states in India and my ability to quickly
        adjust to new challenges in life comes from that. Owing to my diverse
        upbringing, I embrace all cultures and try to bring it to the designs I
        create. I am a movie buff and thereâ€™s nothing like relaxing to a good
        masala Bollywood movie. Food is my second love and I let my nose guide
        me to the pleasures of the stomach once every weekend.
