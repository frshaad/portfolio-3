      My most recent work stint was with Sprinklr where I designed for some of
      its core offerings like Social Media Engagement, Social Advertising, Care
      support and Analytics for big brands with a global reach that helped
      integrate all their social marketing needs under one roof. Having led the
      design team for four years in this young, rapidly growing enterprise
      startup environment - taught me how to balance business goals and
      engineering constraints as I unrelentingly advocated for the user.

      I graduated from Symbiosis Institute of Design, India with a degree in
      User Experience Design. I loved the human-centered design methods and
      processes I learned in school and applied them to my thesis project with
      Microsoft R&D, Hyderabad.

      <br />I grew up in 7 different states in India and my ability to quickly
      adjust to new challenges in life comes from that. Owing to my diverse
      upbringing, I embrace all cultures and try to bring it to the designs I
      create. I am a movie buff and thereâ€™s nothing like relaxing to a good
      masala Bollywood movie. Food is my second love and I let my nose guide me
      to the pleasures of the stomach once every weekend.
